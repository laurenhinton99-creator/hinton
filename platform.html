By title, I’m on the “platform” team. “Platform” in this case meaning my sole purpose is to help portfolio companies get to their next round of fundraising, with a specific focus on the GTM/revenue side. In an ideal world, preferably at a step up as well. I used platform in quotes because it turns out platform has a very different meaning at each firm with some firms not even having a designated platform side, though it’s becoming more common.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has felt a little strange going from being on the investing side: a lovable grind of endless meetings with founders, investor dinners, conferences, memos, etc. to waiting in the starting gate for money to wire and the post-check work to begin. A part of me misses that specific hustle, but I’m starting to find a real challenge and different hustle in providing for a founder after officially earning a spot on their cap table. To which I would argue that to win a spot a firm needs to add value to the founder long before any term sheet is presented.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venture is changing (resetting even, as Benjamin Black so eloquently, and slightly alarmingly, detailed in his newsletter Liquid Thinking), and the way people interact and support founders is changing. I think in the beginning, when the idea of a platform team was even more obscure than it is today, founders were promised customer intros and hiring help, and basically an added extension to their team through platform. The reasons given to founders from VCs today remain pretty similar but I think what’s changing is the optionality for these founders. Lots of firms are adding platform teams that involve talent, community, BD, etc. and every firm’s table stakes differentiator is the same: customer intros and hiring…and maybe lowering AI costs as that is becoming more relevant. Firms are all promising the same things and founders have options.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remove the megafunds, the Sequoia’s and the a16z’s of the world, and founders still have such a competitive pool of options to pick from when it comes to investors. They also have the option to bypass funding altogether (lower headcount costs through implementing AI, seed-straping, second-time-founders-going all-in-with-their-own-money-because-why-not). It’s a brand new world and the pendulum shift is seeming to be more and more in favor of the founder. So how do you build trust to win the founder and keep the founder? This idea of not just seeing the deal but winning the deal and making sure it has the right resources to succeed has been all-consuming.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My hypothesis of where the platform side provides the most value lies somewhere at the intersection of traditional platform work (strategy, hiring, advisory) and community. A partner once told me that a community cannot simply exist. You have to nurture it and you have to provide it with something useful. The tough part is figuring out which incentives actually motivate people to join a community. One that can grow into a broader network and later be thoughtfully activated when appropriate. “Community” in and of itself is broad. Does community in this sense center around partnerships, past founders who want to support in return for equity, GTM councils, or simply gatherings of individuals that enjoy doing similar things?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ambiguous nature of platform can at times feel silly. What does platform do and what does one platform team do better than the next is a question I’m actively trying to answer. I think the future of the platform role in venture is what most respected investors already do, or will do, to remain competitive. In my mind it starts with building trust. I don’t have a clear answer for what platform does, or should do, just yet. What I do know is what platform looked like in the early days versus what it has become today is vastly different.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay tuned as I continue to ponder what being on the platform side means and remain both excited and slightly clueless about how it will evolve.</span></p></div></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
