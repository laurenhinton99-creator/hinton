            "content_html": "<h1 class=\"lh-post-title-heading\">Thought Haver</h1>\n<div class=\"lh-post-date-single\">August 6, 2025</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s the beginning of August, and I’ve prolonged putting my ideas into writing as much as I possibly could as my manager side-eyes me, silently questioning my reluctance to emerge onto the personal newsletter scene. I could probably bunker down and hold out for a few more months but, alas, here I am, starting to share. The direction of this writing is unknown, but it is mine, and there is something comforting about that. To the daring few that choose to read on, welcome to my inner monologue.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve coined a new phrase: “thought-haver.” I definitely didn’t coin that, but I‘ve been saying it for the past month or so. If you’ve been on LinkedIn before, I’m sure you’ve already guessed that this is a play on “thought leader.” I’ve always been curious as to who decides when one morphs into a “thought leader.” Is there a Michelin group handing out brains, or perhaps a collective stream of consciousness that votes quarterly on the world’s top thinkers? Either way, it’s all arbitrary. As people pursue the quest for thought leadership, I have been obsessed with in-person human connection. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With all the noise around us, I believe there is value in silence.“Silence” in this context does not mean that one should not have thoughts and opinions and convictions. Silence is taking conversations offline and seeing how they play out when there is another person who can interject on the other side. There is the possibility for interruption, and you are forced to listen and take a moment before you reply. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most thought leaders are self-appointed, and that’s not something I’m quite comfortable doing. There is so much shared online nowadays, and the earnestness I witness seems to have the opposite effect on me. When someone posts that their family member has passed away on LinkedIn, do I give a condolences thumbs up? I know some people find it cathartic to post these kinds of things, but I struggle to reconcile tech and innovation with my idea of authentic communication. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re in the early years of AI, and it excites me more than it scares me (my job paid me to type that - KIDDING). It really does excite me. To know that humans have the potential to be exponentially more productive, and to create without a technical barrier, is one of the coolest things ever. Something not as cool is a growing culture around AI: the cult of scalability. Scale. Scale. Scale. Scale the business, scale the human, scale everything! I’m learning about the importance of scaling certain processes, but from the perspective of human connection, I couldn’t care less about scale. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Authenticity is difficult to scale, and I don’t believe it should. I’ve wrestled with this one for a while. Connecting with people makes me incredibly happy, so why shouldn’t I do it through an online medium where I can, theoretically, connect with way more? And yet I can’t for the life of me click “post.” I have historically opted for the quality over quantity route. My most authentic, most genuine and, at times, unbearably uncomfortable, connections have formed and strengthened in person. So what should I scale and what should I leave to slowly increase, decline, or even plateau? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I instinctually want to opt for a slow roll on human connectivity: The raw and ugly side of being human that we don’t tend to show online, that takes a bit to pull out of us. These are the parts of humanity that tech has yet to perfect. As a self-proclaimed thought-haver, this writing is allowing me to explore how someone (not a leader, just a thinker) can have something to say, and communicate it in a way that feels personal. At the end of the day, it’s still me, a person, writing what comes to my head (until Ex-Machina me takes over). </span></p>",

            "content_html": "<h1 class=\"lh-post-title-heading\">When Is Failure A Success?</h1>\n<div class=\"lh-post-date-single\">August 13, 2025</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keeping to the theme of last week’s opening, I will start with a conversation I had with my manager last week, side-eye abstained. We discussed some avenues where my writing could go. Should the series be, completely random, a continuous proclamation of sorts to inspire the masses? I’m still toying with my vision for this, but Joe asked a question that gave me some direction: “what do you like to read”? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my head, the immediate answer was a jumbled genre of sci-fy-historic-action-romance-fiction-esque-empowering-biographies. When I thought about it for .5 more seconds, I concluded what reels me in, from a non-fiction POV, are the stories of silent tenacity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love a tale of perseverance, especially those tales that are often not told. What I mean by this is that I find it fascinating to uncover stories that people share long after their trials have become triumphs. I enjoy these stories so much because they are rooted in failure, and reading about someone else’s failure makes me feel less bad about my own. It also begs the question of whether “failure” is really a stagnant state, given that it often is the predecessor to something exciting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think these seemingly stagnant states of failure are often felt by each party in our ecosystem, investors and founders alike. Founders are more boisterous about it because, let’s face it, failure makes for a great come-back narrative, and everyone loves a relentless founder who “defied all the odds.” Investors, to everyone’s surprise, experience these stagnant states as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a multitude of scenarios where the F word came into play in my life. There are almost too many stories to share, but the one that’is the most profane is the failure that would morph into my first paid job. In Common App style, let’s go down the rabbit hole of my ambitious attempt to become a professional athlete. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For some context, my juvenile and collegiate career as an athlete was decimated by relentless injury. I had a back fracture, an ACL tear, foot ligaments stretched, another ACL tear, a pilonidal cyst (steer clear of that google search), ankle problems, and to top it all off, another ACL tear. The sports gods granted me the grace of finishing my sport while still standing, and in response I decided to keep pushing my luck. I turned down a full-time job to pursue a career where a key prerequisite was being healthy: professional soccer. Needless to say, my phone was not blowing up with offers. In the interim, to earn some money, and to distract myself from my phone not ringing, I joined a startup. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joining the startup didn’t feel like a monumental decision, and yet it was the first domino to fall in a series of serendipitous developments that led me to the venture space. To save some time, I’ll condense the journey, and relay that joining the startup led me to working at an accelerator which led me to my first VC role which would subsequently lead to my current VC role. All due to being a terrible ROI in the eyes of pro scouts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The failure to make it professionally has since paved my way into a career I'm still navigating, where failure is viewed almost as a rite of passage. I’m not sure if I’m as comfortable with failure as I want to be, and I’m also not sure if that’s necessarily a bad thing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Losing a game, or losing your ability to walk without crutches, is a form of failure that, in a weird way, is short-term. You know there will be other games, and you hopefully have a great PT specialist that will get you walking in 4-6 weeks. Failure in career ambitions does not always have that near-term light at the end of the tunnel. You’re often left thinking “what now?”, and it can be months or years until that next path forward presents itself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professional failures are disheartening, and often lonely. They’re definitely not something you want to reflect on immediately, write down, and read the next day! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But perceived failure, whether good or bad, ultimately culminates in a future state that is (hopefully) better than the present. To that point, I’m going to advise my three readers to start thinking of professional failures like ACL tears. Extremely painful and exhausting to manage but, in the end, a temporary stagnant state, a short term detour from where you’re heading next. But at the same time, recovery is not straightforward and in that process you may end up in a completely different destination than you intended. And this can be a good thing. To the dreaded “F word” that derailed all my plans: a delayed thank you, for the nudge to trade in my cleats for term sheets. </span></p>",

I’m going to open by saying that this is not meant to read as ingratitude for the position I’m in. The point of this writing is to touch on the industry as a whole, rather than my personal experience. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phewf, now that the disclaimer is out of the way, we can get into the good stuff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be or not to be…a junior VC. HOT TAKE: I can argue why being a junior VC is the coolest job on the market while simultaneously planting my flag in the camp that a junior VC role does not always reflect the hype it elicits.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They say you should save the best for last, but I’m going to go through the best parts first. In a very strange way, junior VCs are the gatekeepers to a lot of General Partners (GPs). The first day on the job, we may not know what the phrase “2 on 20” means, but we sure do know that the GP’s time is way more valuable than our own. A GP wants to be flagged with the good stuff, and a baby VC is typically their screener. Now, whether we actually know where to look is a whole other rabbit hole, but the point is that we get to meet a lot of really interesting and intelligent people. Plus, the GPs bestow a small ounce of trust upon us that we’ll know when there is lightning in a bottle. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that’s pretty cool. I also think that we are less susceptible to venture pattern-matching as naive, dow-eyed VCs. Most of us haven’t been around long enough to see our investments succeed or to recognize when someone is on the cusp of success, and there is opportunity in a fresh perspective. Intrinsically, we want to prove our worth, and we don’t know what we don’t know (yet). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So we take calls, go to events, talk to people on the street. We morph our whole lives into venture – seeking that coveted deal that will ascend through the firm and eventually make its way to the only part of the CRM the GP knows how to operate. More eyeballs in front of deals, and more deals to bring up in everyday conversation; “What would you like to drink?” a friend asks, “Well, I met this founder who is building something really cool in the liquid protein space.” It's an inevitable cringe, but one that keeps deals flowing. Getting to meet and work with founders, even if you don’t ultimately invest, is one of my favorite things. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cringe aside, this all doesn’t sound so bad, yet most people don’t stay. The open operating role for the company fresh off their Series A whispers in an investor’s ear, or the thought of not attending another founder/funder happy hour drives people to a different industry altogether. As we’ve been anticipating, this is where we touch on the not-so-fun times in the life of a junior VC:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s hard to tell, sometimes, if we are the gatekeepers or the gatekept in the structure of a fund. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is it possible to learn how to become a savvy investor when there are often no formal teachers, especially when starting from scratch? GPs have founders to fund and Hampton’s houses to buy, and there is simply not enough time in the day. So where does that leave a junior VC? As the lowest on the totem pole, you may always be sourcing and forming transactional relationships as opposed to career connections. Alternatively, you might live in the back office of the diligence team, grinding away, never to get a whiff of a newly marked-up term sheet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most fall somewhere in between those two roles. A lack of structure and constant ambiguity keep the industry thriving, but it remains brutal for someone navigating it at the beginning of their career. It takes time to refine your evaluation of a deal or a founder, and to learn from those around you. Like many founder &amp; VC relationships, the incentives are not always aligned. Success in venture is measured by deals. Bring in a perceived good deal? Promotion. Structure a deal in the firm's favor? Big applause for you. Manage a junior VC to think critically throughout the diligence process, from sourcing to signing? Zilch. So when should you enter the venture realm, and is there an argument to be made that bypassing the junior role altogether is more beneficial? Maybe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many people within venture – because who else would write about this? – would suggest that the best route to becoming a reputable investor is to have successful angel investments or become an operator before arriving at the VC seat. For those of us who have entered on an earlier timeline, though, it's a tricky one to navigate. You feel like you know a lot when you really know nothing, and you’re recommending or not recommending things as though you were buying Apple stock back in the 90’s. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s a weird state to be in. You’re seemingly an expert at many things, which can be misleading when deciphering what you </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">actually</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> know, and what you need to learn next.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be or not to be a junior VC…that is the question.</span></p>",

            "content_html": "<h1 class=\"lh-post-title-heading\">The Undeniable Linkage Between Startups &amp; Fantasy Football</h1>\n<div class=\"lh-post-date-single\">October 1, 2025</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve been away the past month and I wish I could say it was due to vacation. Alas, the Euro summer will have to wait, as I’ve been doing 637289129 other things that didn’t allow for the self-indulgence of writing with the expectation that someone might actually read it. Tragic!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have no fear, dear readers, the thought-haver has emerged from thinklessness and it’s time to put fingers to keyboard once more. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fair warning: the next couple pieces will most likely be sports-related and this current piece is 100% sports-related, so if that is a snooze fest for you, I advise you read no further. Welcome to my fall thoughts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s yet to be decided on whether football signals the start of fall or fall signals the start of football. “Football” in this context being American football and “fall” being the first Thursday in September. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless, the false fall that is the first week in September is a fun one for me. I grew up in the south and there is little that holds a candle to Friday Night Lights and the start of the season naivete that the Cowboys will be conference champs. The intensity, and arguably obsession, that fans hold for their teams is unmatched. Sundays are for worship and the place of worship is any given living room or local bar that has the game on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, I did something I have never done before: I joined a fantasy football league. I’ll admit, I never understood the appeal of “fantasy” until about a year ago when I caught myself asking questions about the logistics of being in a league. “How does the waiver wire work?” “Is there a punishment for last place?” “Just </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">committed does one have to be to operate a fantasy team?” Turns out a few of my other friends had secretly been thinking of joining a league, and a few of their friends were also curious about how fantasy works, and then three of their friends actually downloaded the app. Before I knew it, I was in a group chat with eleven other fantasy-curious types, participating in a 9pm draft the day before the 2025 NFL season, officially joining the inaugural season of the “Girls 4 Analytics” fantasy football league. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we were going through our draft, some auto drafting while others quickly texted screenshots to their more football-inclined partners, my mind drifted and began connecting fantasy football to startups. Venture has a weird way of creeping into every single detail of your life, whether intentional or not. On this intrusive occasion, I found myself thinking about it for an absurd amount of time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It sounds silly, but doesn’t the first step of fantasy football (the draft) kind of feel like investing in pre-seed startups? To state the most obvious, it’s all about the player. You’re coming into a draft having ideally done your research, some may call it “diligence,” on various players. For the risk lovers, there are new players out there trying to make a name for themselves, but the more risk-averse have the option of going with a proven vet, a player that has a track record of putting up great stats. Each player brings a unique skill set to the table and there are a finite amount of players to choose from. Not everyone can get a piece of Saquon (Barkley, Eagles stud) and you can’t draft only running backs. You need strength across a variety of player positions to have any chance at accumulating points…diversification, if you will. The similarities do not end at the conclusion of the draft.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have your team *cough* *portfolio*, then the real game begins. You’re immediately matched up against someone in your league and are inundated with data. You’re given statistics such as the likelihood you win that week’s matchup, the start percentage of the player you chose, and the projected points for your team that week. It’s equally impressive and intimidating. Most startups have little to no data, but the similarity here is that startups are always competing. Companies are using every bit of information they have to make decisions that will give them an edge over their competition. And so are their investors. The details matter, and even a single percentage point can make all the difference. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fantasy team quickly starts to reveal which players are consistent point-producers and which ones may need extra time to find their fit. It’s not instantaneous, but I’m a few weeks in and I can already start to see which players on my team (portfolio) stand out, which might plateau, or be underperformers. Similar to an investor’s partnership with a startup, there is a chance to intervene. You can swap players out and try a different strategy for the week. This is an art not a science, but there is something to say about a pivot. You can trade players with others in your league which requires advanced negotiation skills and valuing what is a “fair” trade. After all, secondaries can be a very tricky business. It’s a long season and remaining attentive to your team and knowing how to best support your lineup is a crucial part of the fantasy commitment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you aren’t following my train of thought, well, you’re not the first but let me share my last connection to what I believe is very similar to my line of work: Both fantasy football and investing in startups have long feedback loops. The choices you make in September are not fully celebrated or criticized until February. The choices you make to invest in a startup are not fully deemed a success or a failure until year seven or ten. How do you know if your choice at that moment was the right one? That the player you picked is going to be the returner, the one that gives you all the points? Does anyone </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">really</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> know? Not in the beginning, at least.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So why do people keep coming back to fantasy football when their odds to win are slim, there is constant competition, and the season is full of uncertainty? And is the strategy based more on luck or skill? These same questions can be posed to investing in startups, especially startups at the earliest stages. I think the answer lies in the desire to be a part of something great (dramatic for fantasy football, but stick with me). People draft players they believe in and people back companies at the earliest stages that they see extreme potential in. Each draft, or check wire, is a bet in itself and one worth waiting to watch unfold over the course of six months or seven years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, I would be remiss not to mention the role of luck in both fantasy football and startups. There is skill in choosing the right player or the right company to back, but there is also luck in a player staying healthy all season and a company building at the right time. People will keep playing fantasy and investors will keep investing in startups, and whether the end results reflect luck or skill is still an open question. I do think about this a lot, probably too much, the balance between luck and skill. It’s too soon to say which of the two will influence the rankings most in the Girls 4 Analytics league, but all I can say is that I got super lucky to land the #1 pick for our draft and I’m also 0-4 for the year. </span></p>",
