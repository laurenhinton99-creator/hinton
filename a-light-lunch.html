I’ve also (internally) stated that I want to write at least once a month, so when mid-January arrived and NOTHING that seemed even the slightest intriguing entered my brain, I wondered if my ambitions were mightier than my keyboard. We all know the “people abandon their resolutions two weeks into January” stat and there was genuine concern that I would be falling victim to that “Quitter’s Day” trope.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My fears dwindled when an email landed in my inbox accompanied by an invitation to attend a lunch with a dear friend of mine. On any other day, attending a lunch on January 16th with this friend would have been impossible: 12:30pm on a Friday outside the city is tough…unless you have the luxury of time, then anything goes. Not to mention, this friend is an angel of a human, an absolute superstar, and someone that I don’t get to see as much as I wish I could. Needless to say, I was sitting on a train at 10am watching the city rush past and looking forward to catching up over what I could only assume would be a great meal.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon arrival, I quickly learned that this invitation was sent to an intimate group whose attendees ranged from various fields including the corporate side, the doctors, and the policy folk. I want to clarify that my particular invitation was not intended to equate me to the other lunch participants. I was purely there to catch up with my friend, but I found myself lucky enough to sit at the same table as these guests. I’ll pause to acknowledge that this description is a bit vague, dare I say…mysterious? It’s not intended to be. I want to respect my friend and for that I’m withholding invasive details because you just never know who is going to stumble upon this repository of writing.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anywho, a few of the guests that hailed from the political side of the world had a lot to say. I think anyone, political or not, has a lot to say these days. I’ll be the first to claim that politics is an area I could brush up on. Admittedly, I get disheartened when trying to navigate all that is politics. Politics and politicians have always felt to me a touch performative. A lot of talk with little action. A lot of promises with little follow through. Oh how I was educated at this table on January 16th!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main takeaway from that discussion was that at a micro level, some things actually get done. There is value in being someone who has their boots on the ground, knows one’s constituents, and devotes everything to solving the problem they campaigned on from the start. The very specific promises, almost a specialization of sorts, are the areas where measurable impact can be seen. The reality of (certain) people getting things done within the political realm got me thinking. Reality check: I know not everything is related to startups or venture or New York but as a free-willing participant in reading this article you are at the mercy of following this comparison.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I kept coming back to the niche issues each person focused on. For example, the woman I sat next to was focused on infant mortality rates in one specific suburb. Her whole job is devoted to this problem and she eats, sleeps, and breathes everything having to do with this issue. An obsession mingled with passion to make things better. Doing one thing extremely well and with extreme ferocity to move the needle. If the correlation hasn’t smacked you in the face off the page yet, I’m writing to say that there was a founder in my midst.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And people thought my fantasy football comparison was bonkers.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Call me crazy, but I had a renewed sense of politics, at least at the local level, that day. It felt like I had entered a world I know nothing about and found it to be oddly similar to the world I know all too well. There are people who experience, relate, or seek out a problem and then obsessively work to fix that problem. It’s a drive that is fueled by various factors but at the highest level its foundation is about working toward making something better. Isn’t that what entrepreneurship and politics are intended to do?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main conversation was carried out by our host who made it a point to hear from every single person sitting at the table. Not forcefully, but with delicate intention on when it was time for someone new to chime in. It was orchestrated flawlessly and the conversation never seemed to lull. I was perfectly content listening to it all and hearing where each person (founder) was making an impact around the table. I chimed in on a few things in my head. The day in its entirety was full of surprises so I should not have been shocked when our host presented her final question: for the few in attendance just at the start of their journeys, and coming from a younger generation, what are you hopeful about? Talk about a closer!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The youngins at the table, five of us total, piped up. Each of us coming from a different world of our own (corporate, real estate, MBA programming, and venture capital) took the conversation in various directions. With my heart beating wildly out of my chest, caught off guard by my own nervousness to speak, I exclaimed that my bit of hopefulness stemmed from the idea that as our political democracy seems to deteriorate the access to innovation continues to democratize. There has never been a time like the present where accessibility to build has been so widely attainable. I got a few “snaps” at the table and took that as a win.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In plain English, everyone now can be a founder, today more than ever before.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wish I could better articulate the impact this meal had on me. The reminder that people always have been and always will seek to innovate in their own way was a beautiful reminder. What we work for, what we specialize and obsess over, is worthwhile.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t get the sense that everyone at that table left feeling hopeful, but I sure did. I was comforted by the knowledge that everyone is building for something and in turn everyone is then a founder. So, I’m here to petition on these final days in January that whatever sector you self-bucket into, remember that you are a founder and that in itself is powerful.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To more thought-provoking gatherings…preferably those that include lunch.</span></p></div></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
